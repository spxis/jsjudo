- Describe Object Composition vs Class Inheritance!!! (Gang of Four 1995:20): Inheritance (white-box: internals are visible, "inheritance breaks encapsulation because it exposes a subclass to details of it's parent's implentation") vs object composition (black-box: no internal details are known)

# JavaScript and Object-Oriented Programming

- What is Inheritance? Inheritance refers to an object being able to inherit methods and properties from a parent object (Function).
- What is Encapsulation? Enclosing all the functionalities of an object within that object so that the objectâ€™s internal workings (its methods and properties) are hidden from the rest of the application. 
- What is Polymorphism? Objects can share the same interface (how they are accessed and used) while their underlying implementation of the interface may differ.
- What is the Object.prototype? The top of the prototype chain. The properties and methods that all objects inherit from. 
- What is a Constructor? A function for initializing new objects. You use the new keyword to call the constructor. 
- What is a Function property? A variable defined on a function.
- What is a Prototype? It defines the shape of an object. 
- What is a Prototype property? A property on an object that contains properties and methods, used with Inheritance. This property is available to all instances of that object [function].
- What is a Prototype attribute? The parent of an object, where its properties were inherited from.
- What is Object.create()? Introduced in ECMAScript 5, founded by Douglas Crockford. Helps achieve classical inheritance. This method creates a new object with the specified prototype object and properties.
- What is a Mixin? A function that copies functions from superclass prototypoe to the subclass prototype.
- What is the difference between Function Declarations and Function Expression? Function Declarations are hoisted while Function Expressions are not.
- What happens when a function is wrapped in parentheses? The result is evaluated as an expression, since the parentheses constitute a grouping operator and they can only contain an expression.
- What is a closure? An inner function that has access to the outer (enclosing) function's variables (scope). 
- What are the 3 scope chains for a closure? own scope, outer function variables, global variables.
- What does the hasOwnProperty() method do? Tells you if the object has it's own property with the specified name, not an inherited property.
- What are the methods used to Serialize and Deserialize Objects? JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse().
- How do you delete a project of an Object? Use the delete operator, delete someObject.propertyToDelete.

# Notes on Closures
- Closures have access to the outer function's variable, even after the outer function returns;
- Closures store references to outer function variables, not the actual value
- Closures require care when outer function variables change, since variables are by reference, if they change, the values will change as well.
